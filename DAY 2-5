You are a data analyst working for a company that sells products online. You have been tasked with analyzing the sales data for the past month. The data is stored in a NumPy array.
Question: How would you find the average price of all the products sold in the past month? Assume 3x3 matrix with each row representing the sales for a different product


) import numpy as np

# Example data creation for demonstration purposes
# Assume each row represents a different product, and each column represents different sales transactions
sales_data = np.array([
    [100, 150, 200],  # Product 1 sales
    [120, 180, 240],  # Product 2 sales
    [130, 170, 210]   # Product 3 sales
])

# Calculate the average price of all products sold
average_price = sales_data.mean()

# Display the result
print(f"The average price of all products sold in the past month is: {average_price:.2f}")
