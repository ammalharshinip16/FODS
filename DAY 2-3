Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a company that sells products online. You have been tasked with analyzing the sales data for the past month. The data is stored in a Pandas data frame.
Question: Develop a code in python to find the frequency distribution of the ages of the customers who have made a purchase in the past month.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data creation for demonstration purposes
data = {
    'customer_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'age': [22, 25, 22, 23, 25, 24, 23, 24, 22, 25],
    'purchase_amount': [120, 150, 100, 200, 300, 250, 160, 180, 140, 210]
}

# Creating a DataFrame
sales_data = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate frequency distribution of ages
age_distribution = sales_data['age'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Display the frequency distribution
print("Frequency distribution of ages:\n", age_distribution)

# Visualize the distribution with a bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
age_distribution.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Frequency Distribution of Customer Ages')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
